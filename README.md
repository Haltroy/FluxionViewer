Please refer to the appropiate OS version from the project file for that specific platform (ex. FluxionViewer.Android/FluxionViewer.Android.csproj).

## Build

Requires [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com) (latest available).

If using another .NET version, please change the "TargetFramework" versions of each .csproj file accordingly. We prefer
using the latest LTS version of .NET.

To build, head to the folder of any trget system (ex. BlueLabel.Linux) and run "dotnet publish" to build it (ex. dotnet
build -r linux-x64 -c Release). The application should be inside the bin folder of that folder.
